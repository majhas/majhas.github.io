I am a Master's student in computer science at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/) supervised by [Dominique Beaini](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/dbeaini).

I am primarily interested in the development of methods for generative models (more specifically dynamical measure transport) and geometric deep learning as well as their application in molecular dynamics, conformation sampling, quantum chemistry, and protein-ligand interaction.

Previously, I was an Associate Machine Learning Scientist at AbbVie working on Graph Neural Networks, chemisity, ADME property prediction, and de novo molecular generation.

Prior to that, I completed my Bachlors in computer engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2019.

Please reach out if there is anything you would like to discuss!
