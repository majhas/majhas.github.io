I am a Master's student in computer science supervised by [Dominique Beaini](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/dbeaini). 

I am primarily interested in generative models (more specifically dynamical measure transport) and geometric deep learning applied on molecular dynamics, conformation sampling, quantum chemistry, and protein-ligand interaction.

Previously, I was an Associate Machine Learning Scientist at AbbVie working on Graph Neural Networks, chemisity, ADME property prediction, and de novo molecular generation.

Prior to that, I completed my Bachlors in computer engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2019.
