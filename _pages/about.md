I am a PhD student in computer science at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/) supervised by [Dominique Beaini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbeaini/) and [Kirill Neklyudov](https://necludov.github.io/) .

I am primarily interested in developing methods for generative modeling and sampling, and their application to problems in the molecular sciences such as electronic structure, molecular dynamics, conformational sampling, and protein-ligand interaction.

Previously, I was an Associate Machine Learning Scientist at AbbVie working on Graph Neural Networks, chemisity, ADME property prediction, and de novo molecular generation.

Prior to that, I completed my Bachlors in computer engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2019.
